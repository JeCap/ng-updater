# ng-updater

## about

ng-update helps you to execute your angular updates in one step. It execute `ng update` of the angular cli to get the update packages. Afterwards these packages (if available) are installed with `ng update package, package,... --force --allow-dirty`.

## install

Install directly to your angular project

`npm install @jecap/ng-updater -D`

or globally

`npm install @jecap/ng-updater -g`

### Remember

`ng-update` is only provided as an npm package on github. So you need to add `@jecap:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com`to your `.npmrc`

```ini
registry=http://registry.npmjs.org
@jecap:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

## how to use

That's simple. Execute `ngu` or `npx ngu` in your shell.

```dos
> ngu
execute: ng update
